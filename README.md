# Jimm's Achievement System
### (For the Unity Game Engine)
Hey! This is a simple achievement system I've decided to make for fun.
Right now, there's basic achievement completion functionality (saving included).

I also added an _achievement toast_ (the little thing that appears in the corner telling you you completed the achievement)!

Here's how the project looks:

> NOTE: If you want the achievements to work properly, make sure that both AchievementSystem & ToastCanvas exist on all scenes. 
The 'Achievements View' can be disabled if you don't want it to be visible.

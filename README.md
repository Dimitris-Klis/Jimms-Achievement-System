# Jimm's Achievement System

Hey! This is a simple achievement system I've decided to make for fun.
Right now, there's basic achievement completion functionality (saving included).

Something I might add soon is an _achievement toast_ (the little thing that appears in the corner telling you you completed the achievement). 

Here's how the project looks currently:

Stay Tuned!
